Display a widget with eight most frequently called contacts. No need to organize them maually on desktop anymore.

See getting started guide at http://phonepony.appspot.com/

You can get the application in the market under "Frequent Contacts Widget". More details in getting started guide.

Sadly, I had to remove frequent messages part of the code. There is no defined API for getting messages, and this caused the messages part to fail on some devices. I have no intention to support every type of messaging application, so I'm removing it.

Application can also be downloaded at http://android.pdassi.de/product.php?prod_id=122714
