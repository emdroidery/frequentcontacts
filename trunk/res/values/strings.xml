    <string name="wdg_tab_text">Instead of \"running\" Frequent Contacts application, you can add two widgets to your
        home screen. The first one is \"Frequent Calls\", where you can view and directly dial to your most frequently
        called contacts. Second one is "Frequent Messages",
        where you can view and send messages to frequently messaged contacts.\n
        Insert a widget, long press in an empty area on the home screen, select \"Widgets\" and select either \"Frequent
        Calls\" or \"Frequent Messages\". You can select both of them by performing this process twice.
